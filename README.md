# Linear-Regression-in-R
The following github repository involves comprehensive Linear Regression analysis in R. It includes fitting the regression model and plotting diagnostic measures to assess its performance. Additionally, confidence and prediction intervals are measured to evaluate the model's precision.

Furthermore, the implementation explores various regression techniques, including Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and Lasso regression. Diagnostic plots are used to gain insights into the model's assumptions and identify potential issues.

Moreover, Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression is applied to handle heteroskedasticity, enhancing the accuracy of predictions. The implementation offers a thorough investigation into regression modeling, making it a valuable resource for understanding and implementing these techniques effectively.
